# Synth Flashcard Generator - Claude Context

## Project Overview
Synth is an AI-powered flashcard generation and study application built with Spring Boot and Next.js. The application allows users to create flashcard decks from uploaded content, study with AI-powered grading, and track their learning progress.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.2.0 with PostgreSQL database
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for flashcard generation and answer grading
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with Spring Security
- **Email Service**: Resend integration for transactional emails
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose for development, Railway for production

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- **User Authentication**: Registration, login, JWT token management
- **Email System**: Complete Resend integration for password reset and email confirmation
- **Password Reset**: Secure token-based password reset with HTML email templates
- **Email Confirmation**: User email verification with secure token system
- **Input Validation**: Strong password requirements and comprehensive form validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse on authentication and email endpoints
- **Flashcard Creation**: Generate flashcards from file uploads or text input using Gemini AI
- **Study Interface**: Answer-first study flow with AI grading and detailed feedback
- **Progress Tracking**: Resume study sessions, track completion, and save progress to database
- **Dashboard**: View all decks with mastery scores and continue studying options
- **Spaced Repetition**: Basic difficulty adjustment based on performance
- **Study Analytics**: Track study sessions with scores and completion rates
- **Security Hardening**: CORS configuration, JWT secret management, input sanitization

### ðŸ”§ Current MVP Gaps (Production Readiness)

#### Essential User Features Missing:
- User profile management page
- Error boundaries and proper error handling
- 404/error pages
- Domain verification for email sending (currently requires onboarding@resend.dev)

#### Production Infrastructure Needs:
- Railway deployment configuration
- Custom domain setup for email sending
- Environment variable management for production
- Production database configuration
- Basic monitoring and health checks
- SSL/TLS certificate setup

users (id, email, password, email_verified, subscription_tier, created_at)
decks (id, name, description, user_id, created_at)
cards (id, question, answer, difficulty, deck_id)
study_sessions (id, user_id, card_id, response, score, confidence, feedback, studied_at)
study_progress (id, user_id, deck_id, current_card_index, total_cards, cards_completed, is_completed, last_studied_at)

-- Email system
email_confirmation_tokens (id, token, user_id, created_at, expires_at, used)
password_reset_tokens (id, token, user_id, created_at, expires_at, used)
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration (sends email confirmation)
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Request password reset email
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Reset password with token
- `POST /api/auth/confirm-email` - Confirm email with token
- `POST /api/auth/resend-confirmation` - Resend email confirmation

### Deck Management
- `GET /api/decks/stats` - Get user's decks with statistics
- `POST /api/decks/upload` - Create deck from file upload
- `POST /api/decks/text` - Create deck from text input

### Study System
- `GET /api/study/deck/{deckId}` - Get cards for studying
- `POST /api/study/answer` - Submit answer for AI grading
- `GET /api/study/progress/{deckId}` - Get study progress
- `POST /api/study/progress/{deckId}` - Save study progress
- `DELETE /api/study/progress/{deckId}` - Clear study progress

## AI Integration (Gemini API)

### Flashcard Generation
The application uses Gemini AI to generate flashcards from user-provided content:
- Analyzes text/documents to extract key concepts
- Creates question-answer pairs optimized for learning
- Supports multiple question types and difficulty levels

### Answer Grading
AI-powered answer evaluation provides:
- Semantic similarity scoring (0.0 to 1.0)
- Confidence rating for the score
- Detailed feedback explaining the grade
- Considers partial credit for close answers

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Java 17+
- Node.js 18+

## MVP Launch Priorities

### âœ… Phase 1 (Completed)
1. âœ… Fix security configurations (CORS, JWT, credentials)
2. âœ… Add password reset functionality
3. âœ… Add rate limiting and input validation
4. âœ… Email verification system
5. âœ… Strong password requirements

### ðŸ”§ Phase 2 (Current Priority)
1. Deploy to Railway for production testing

4. Final testing and bug fixes

## Known Issues
- Domain verification required for email sending (currently uses onboarding@resend.dev)
- Missing user profile management
- No data export capabilities
- Limited error handling and user feedback
- Frontend uses development server in Docker

## Testing
Currently lacks comprehensive testing. Needs:
- Unit tests for backend services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Frontend component testing
- End-to-end testing for critical flows

## Deployment Notes
- **Railway Deployment**: Ready for production deployment on Railway
- **Email Service**: Configured with Resend API for transactional emails
- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data managed via environment variables
- **Database**: PostgreSQL ready for production with proper migrations
- **SSL/TLS**: Handled automatically by Railway
- **Docker**: Multi-stage builds for optimized production containers

## Performance Considerations
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- JPA lazy loading configured
- Frontend uses React best practices
- Gemini API calls are optimized for batch processing
- Progress tracking minimizes database writes

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Deck sharing and collaboration
- Advanced spaced repetition algorithms
- Mobile app or PWA
- Integration with external services (Anki, Quizlet)
- Advanced analytics and insights
- Bulk import/export features
