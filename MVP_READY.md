# 🚀 Synth Flashcard Generator - MVP Ready for Launch!

## ✅ Production Readiness Completed

Your flashcard application is now **production-ready** for MVP launch! Here's what has been implemented:

### 🔒 Security Fixes (CRITICAL - COMPLETED)

1. **✅ CORS Configuration Fixed**
   - Restricted to specific domains via `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable
   - No longer allows all origins (`*`)
   - Production-safe configuration

2. **✅ JWT Security Hardened** 
   - Strong JWT secret configuration via environment variables
   - No more weak fallback keys
   - Configurable expiration times

3. **✅ Input Validation & Sanitization**
   - Comprehensive validation on all DTOs
   - Rate limiting on critical endpoints (login, register, password reset)
   - Global exception handling with secure error messages

4. **✅ Password Reset System**
   - Secure token-based password reset
   - Rate-limited endpoints
   - Proper token expiration and cleanup

### 🏗️ Production Infrastructure (COMPLETED)

1. **✅ Production Docker Configuration**
   - Multi-stage frontend build with security optimizations
   - Non-root user containers
   - Health checks for all services
   - Redis for rate limiting and caching

2. **✅ Health Monitoring**
   - Spring Boot Actuator endpoints
   - Container health checks
   - Service dependency management

3. **✅ Error Handling**
   - React Error Boundaries for graceful frontend failures
   - Global exception handler with correlation IDs
   - User-friendly 404 and error pages
   - Structured error responses

4. **✅ Security Headers**
   - X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
   - XSS Protection, Referrer Policy
   - Content Security Policy ready

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability (COMPLETED)

1. **✅ Application Monitoring**
   - Health check endpoints (`/actuator/health`)
   - Structured logging with configurable levels
   - Error tracking and correlation IDs

2. **✅ Rate Limiting**
   - Redis-based distributed rate limiting
   - Configurable limits per endpoint
   - IP-based tracking with fallback handling

### 🗄️ Database & Storage (COMPLETED)

1. **✅ Production Database Setup**
   - Secure PostgreSQL configuration
   - Environment-based credentials
   - Connection pooling optimization
   - Health monitoring

2. **✅ Data Integrity**
   - Password reset token management
   - Session cleanup and expiration
   - Proper entity relationships
