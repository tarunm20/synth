Chemistry Fundamentals

Atomic Structure

Atom: The smallest unit of matter that retains the properties of an element.

Proton: A positively charged particle found in the nucleus of an atom.

Neutron: A neutral particle (no charge) found in the nucleus of an atom.

Electron: A negatively charged particle that orbits the nucleus in electron shells.

Atomic Number: The number of protons in an atom's nucleus, which determines the element.

Mass Number: The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom's nucleus.

Isotope: Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons.

Ion: An atom or molecule with a net electric charge due to loss or gain of electrons.

Chemical Bonding

Covalent Bond: A chemical bond formed by sharing electrons between atoms.

Ionic Bond: A chemical bond formed by the transfer of electrons from one atom to another.

Metallic Bond: A chemical bond found in metals where electrons are delocalized.

Hydrogen Bond: A weak attraction between a hydrogen atom and an electronegative atom.

Polar Molecule: A molecule with an uneven distribution of electron density.

Nonpolar Molecule: A molecule with an even distribution of electron density.

Electronegativity: The ability of an atom to attract electrons in a chemical bond.

Chemical Reactions

Reactant: A substance that participates in a chemical reaction.

Product: A substance formed as a result of a chemical reaction.

Catalyst: A substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without being consumed.

Activation Energy: The minimum energy required to start a chemical reaction.

Exothermic Reaction: A reaction that releases energy, usually in the form of heat.

Endothermic Reaction: A reaction that absorbs energy from the surroundings.

Combustion: A chemical reaction involving oxygen that produces heat and light.

Synthesis Reaction: A reaction where two or more substances combine to form one product.

Decomposition Reaction: A reaction where one compound breaks down into simpler substances.

States of Matter

Solid: A state of matter with definite shape and volume due to strong intermolecular forces.

Liquid: A state of matter with definite volume but no definite shape.

Gas: A state of matter with no definite shape or volume.

Plasma: A state of matter consisting of ionized gas with free electrons and ions.

Melting Point: The temperature at which a solid becomes a liquid.

Boiling Point: The temperature at which a liquid becomes a gas.

Sublimation: The direct transition from solid to gas without passing through liquid phase.

Condensation: The change from gas to liquid state.

Solutions and Mixtures

Solution: A homogeneous mixture of two or more substances.

Solvent: The substance present in the largest amount in a solution.

Solute: The substance dissolved in a solvent.

Concentration: The amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent.

Molarity: The number of moles of solute per liter of solution.

pH: A scale measuring the acidity or basicity of a solution.

Acid: A substance that donates hydrogen ions (H+) in solution.

Base: A substance that accepts hydrogen ions or donates hydroxide ions (OH-).

Buffer: A solution that resists changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added.
