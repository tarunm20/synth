Mathematics Fundamentals

Algebra

Variable: A symbol (usually a letter) that represents an unknown value in an equation.

Coefficient: A number that multiplies a variable in an algebraic expression.

Constant: A fixed value that does not change in an equation or expression.

Linear Equation: An equation where the highest power of the variable is 1.

Quadratic Equation: An equation where the highest power of the variable is 2.

Polynomial: An expression consisting of variables and coefficients using addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

Factor: A number or expression that divides another number or expression evenly.

Slope: The measure of steepness of a line, calculated as rise over run.

Y-intercept: The point where a line crosses the y-axis.

System of Equations: A set of two or more equations with the same variables.

Geometry

Point: A location in space with no dimension, represented by a dot.

Line: A straight path extending infinitely in both directions.

Ray: A part of a line that starts at one point and extends infinitely in one direction.

Line Segment: A part of a line bounded by two endpoints.

Angle: The space between two intersecting lines or rays, measured in degrees.

Perpendicular: Lines that intersect at a 90-degree angle.

Parallel: Lines that never intersect and are always the same distance apart.

Triangle: A polygon with three sides and three angles.

Quadrilateral: A polygon with four sides and four angles.

Circle: A round shape where all points are equidistant from the center.

Circumference: The distance around the outside of a circle.

Area: The amount of space inside a two-dimensional shape.

Perimeter: The distance around the outside of a polygon.

Volume: The amount of space inside a three-dimensional object.

Trigonometry

Sine: The ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle.

Cosine: The ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle.

Tangent: The ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle.

Hypotenuse: The longest side of a right triangle, opposite the right angle.

Pythagorean Theorem: In a right triangle, a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse.

Statistics and Probability

Mean: The average of a set of numbers, calculated by adding all values and dividing by the count.

Median: The middle value in a sorted list of numbers.

Mode: The value that appears most frequently in a data set.

Range: The difference between the highest and lowest values in a data set.

Standard Deviation: A measure of how spread out the values in a data set are.

Probability: The likelihood of an event occurring, expressed as a fraction or percentage.

Sample: A subset of a population used to make inferences about the whole population.

Population: The entire group being studied in a statistical analysis.

Correlation: A statistical relationship between two variables.

Regression: A statistical method for modeling the relationship between variables.
